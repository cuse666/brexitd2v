Although it has only 10 seats in parliament, compared with the 317 seats of the conservative party and the 262 seats of the Labour party, it is only a small party. However, the conservative party lost in the 2017 general election, and only the 10-seat DUP could retain the governing position with a slim majority. This led to the final stage of brexit being held back by the DUP of a hard brexit."

ge17,"A turning point for brexit. Without the election, the conservatives would still have a majority in parliament, and the road to brexit would have been less bumpy.

Now it seems reasonable to lose the election."

ireland,"Ireland is divided into Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) and the republic of Ireland. The Irish republican army (IRA), which wanted to unite Ireland by force, saw Britain as the aggressor, and Northern Ireland's border conflict bore the brunt. Almost every year between 1970 and 1997, London was hit by a bomb that shocked the world. The violence largely stopped when the two sides signed a peace agreement in 1998.

In fact, the British economy has not shown much weakness in two years. The comments were dismissed by brexiteers as a threat to block brexit.

Immigration has been tightened in recent years, with members of the windswept generation deemed illegal. The political scandal was revealed in 2018, bringing abuse to the ruling conservative party and prompting repeated apologies from the prime minister and home secretary. The incident reflects the sensitivity of British society to the issue of immigration in the post-referendum era. On the one hand, anti-immigrant sentiment is on the rise, and on the other hand, society is more sensitive to the protection of immigrant rights."
